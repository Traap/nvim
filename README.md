### Linux Bash Installation

I clone or pull Neovim source code and build it using [resetNeovim](https://github.com/Traap/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/resetNeovim).

Backups are not done. *You have been warned.*

Here's what happens:
1. Use [switchNeovim](https://github.com/Traap/dotfiles/blob/master/bash/bin/switchNeovim) switchNeovim to switch to my Neovim configuration.
2. User [bnvim](https://github.com/Traap/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/bnvim) to rebuild Neovim from source.
3. Bootstrap Neovim.

### LunarVim Configuration
This repository and [lvim](https://github.com/traap/lvim) are similar.  I use LunarVim defaults where they make
since to me and do not conflict too much with configurations done here.
